# Description

This is a simple react redux starter app which covers some of the things I learned the hard way over the last year, which are:

1. Modularized SASS with third-party css;
2. Importing third-party libs with other dependencies(here I use bootstrap.js which depends on tether and jQuery);
3. Using jQuery with react components(ref + provide + eslint config) on SearchBar tooltip for a simple demonstration;
4. Folder structure for modules + submodules (github would be a module, search a submodule);
5. Configure webpack for development and production, including compressing files to host on static pages(s3, github, etc.);
6. General redux config and folder structure I like to use;
7. Eslint config.

# Usage

npm install
npm start
```
